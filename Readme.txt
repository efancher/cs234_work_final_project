This code is for my final project for CS234.
I did a replication review of
Dimakopoulou, M., Osband, I., and Roy, B. V.
Scalable coordinated exploration in concurrent
reinforcement learning. CoRR, abs/1805.08948, 2018.
URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08948.

Bipolar chain was done mostly in notebook:
Final Project CS238.ipynb
with MDP code in Agent.jl

Parallel Chain was implemented in RunPC.jl, with MDP code in ParallelChains.jl

Maximum reward path was implemented in RunMR.jl, with MDP code in MaximumRewardPath.jl

Final report is in project_update/final_report.tex (or .pdf, if you prefer)
